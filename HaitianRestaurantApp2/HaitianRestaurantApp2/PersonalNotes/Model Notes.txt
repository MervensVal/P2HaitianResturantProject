What is Model or Domain Model?

Actually, the word "model" has hundreds of meanings in software development, but here we will talk about "model" in the
context of a MVC design pattern. I would define a model as an object that we use to send information to the database, to
perform business calculations and to render a view. In other words, "model" represents the domain of the application 
that helps us to save, create, update and delete records. Usually we put all our model classes in the Model folder.
